        "prompt": "As an AI model, your task is to create a comprehensive agenda for an upcoming podcast episode. This episode is hosted by three Microsoft MVPs who are seasoned Power BI professionals. Their diverse professional journeys, from engineering to consultancy and directorship, bring unique perspectives to the table on Business Intelligence and Power BI. Their focus is on comprehending the 'why' over the 'how,' delving into technical aspects like DAX, data modeling, as well as higher-level concepts such as data culture, adoption, and trust.\\n\\nThey believe in the existence of grey areas in Power BI's implementation and success within organizations. For instance, they argue that the quality of a report can be subjective, and there's no such thing as a 'perfect report.' Further, they appreciate that the impact of Power BI on an organization transcends mere technology or feature implementation; it significantly influences the organization's culture and operations.\\n\\nYour task is to design a podcast agenda that aligns with these viewpoints. The format comprises three main sections: Setup, Confrontation, and Resolution. These segments foster free-flowing and natural dialogue among the hosts. The Setup section introduces the topic and explains its relevance. The Confrontation segment provokes thought and challenges the status quo with rigorous questions. The Resolution section consolidates the hosts' final thoughts and conclusions.\\n\\nDrawing from past episodes, such as 'Changing Roles in Microsoft Fabric Domains', 'The Symbiotic Relationship Between Data Governance & Data Storytelling', 'What is a Data Model?', 'Are Power BI Champions Integral to Adoption?' and 'How To Build Data Literacy', can provide a solid foundation for developing your agenda. Your primary objective is to create an agenda that encourages engaging and dynamic discussions, mirroring the hosts' penchant for open dialogue and constructive disagreement.\\n\\nStructure of Agenda:\\n\\n**Setup**\\n\\n- Introduce the topic of the subtleties and 'grey areas' inherent in Power BI implementation within organizations.\\n- Discuss the roles and experiences of our three hosts and how they might inform the conversation.\\n- Overview of the typical Power BI implementation process, focusing on the why's rather than the how's.\\n- Share a link to a thought-provoking article or piece of news about Power BI implementation.\\n\\n**Confrontation**\\n\\n- Dive into the 'grey areas' of Power BI implementation. How can these be approached and navigated?\\n- Discuss the hosts' personal experiences with Power BI implementation. Have they encountered these 'grey areas'? If so, how have they dealt with them?\\n- Debate the statement: \\There is no perfect report\\. What does this mean in the context of Power BI implementation and report generation?\\n- Explore the implications of the 'grey areas' for different roles within an organization (engineer, consultant, director of BI). How might the approach differ based on the role?\\n- Discuss a provocative question or statement from the shared article/link. Encourage hosts to provide their unique viewpoints.\\n\\n**Resolution**\\n\\n- Summarize the main points of the discussion. What are the key takeaways about the 'grey areas' of Power BI implementation?\\n- Each host shares their final thoughts on the topic. What can listeners do to better understand and navigate these 'grey areas'?\\n- Wrap up the episode with a call-to-action for listeners to share their own experiences and thoughts on the topic.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nExamples of past Agendas:\\n\\nEpisode: Changing Roles in Microsoft Fabric Domains\\nCategory: Fabric\\nLinks\\nFabric Domains\\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/governance/domains?WT.mc_id=DP-MVP-5002621\\nSetup\\n\\t• Roles now (pre fabric)\\n\\t• What is the current workflow with processes\\n\\t• What are domains\\n\\t• What changes\\n\\nConfrontation\\n\\t• How do the people change with Domains\\n\\t• Are new people introduced\\n\\t\\t○ BI\\n\\t\\t○ IT\\n\\t\\t○ Consumers\\n\\t• What workflows change\\n\\t• Are domains a radical shift\\n\\nResolution\\n\\t• Final Thoughts\\n-----\\nEpisode: The Symbiotic Relationship Between Data Governance & Data Storytelling\\nCategory: Platform / Skills, Admin / Enterprise\\nLinks \\nhttps://medium.com/regular-thoughts-of-a-multipreneur/the-symbiotic-relationship-between-data-governance-and-data-storytelling-d1db76fde5ad\\n\\nSetup\\n\\t• Setting up the article\\n\\t• How does data storytelling enhance the value of data governance?\\n\\t• How does governance it support the \\process\\ of storytelling?\\n\\t• Can storytelling translate the outcomes of data governance?\\n\\nConfrontation\\n\\t• Can data governance slow down or limit data storytelling?\\n\\t• What conflicts could arise?\\n\\t• Where do you disagree?\\n\\nResolution\\n\\t• Can organizations create the desired relationship between storytelling & governance?\\n\\t• Can you see the fruits or evidence of one effecting another?\\nHow would that be apparent? \\n\\n-----\\n\\nEpisode:  What is a Data Model?\\nCategory: Platform / Skills,\\nLinks\\nhttps://data-mozart.com/data-modeling-for-mere-mortals-part-1-what-is-data-modeling/\\n\\nSetup\\n\\t• Discussing the article\\n\\t• The idea that data modeling is an investment for the business?\\n\\t• What is the relationship between data modeling and trust in the business?\\n\\t• Why is the idea of a conceptual data model important?\\n\\t\\t○ Does it simplify the business processes and entities?\\n\\t\\t○ How does it help build trust?\\n\\t• What is a logical data model?\\n\\nConfrontation\\n\\t• Can the business accept the concept of as investment?
